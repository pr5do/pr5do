Enthusiast of web technologies, cryptography, decentralized applications, cybersecurity, AI, computer science, and applied math.

Willing to build things that can change how people live.

As my goal, I'm willing to build projects that I'm proud of and connect with many people as possible.

Nowadays I'm very passionate about cryptocurrencies, so, currently, I'm learning C++ to create my protocol and, further in the future, I'm intending to learn about web technologies, cryptography, and cybersecurity to create the best application that I'm can create. This is one of the strongest features in me, when I want to do something I will stick to it until I get it done in the best way I can.
