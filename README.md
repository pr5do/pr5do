Enthusiast of web technologies, cryptography, decentralized applications, cybersecurity, AI, computer science and applied math.

Wanting to build things that can possibly change how people live.

As my goal, I'm willing to build projects that I'm proud of and connect with many people as possible.

Nowadays I'm very passionate about cryptocurrencies, so, currently, I'm learning C++ to create my protocol and further in the future I'm willing to learn about web technologies, cryptography and cybersecurity to create the best application that I'm can possibly create.
